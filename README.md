## TODOS / Ideas

- [x] A Guides page
- [x] A Parts submission page
- [ ] Omni-search should show stratifications (see Opticsplanet) to aid site navigation (Guides, Ammo, etc.)
- [ ] Rollup your folders into a nice automatically generated Navbar/Sidebar
- [ ] [Global Error handling](https://code-maze.com/global-error-handling-aspnetcore/)
- [ ] Add a global error handler
- [ ] Add a special Daisy Toast for errors
- [ ] Log to Airtable a la LogRow.cs
- [ ] Add an Admin panel for viewing logs
- [ ] Feature voting Poll (max 3)
- [ ] Let users verify something works with a "Proof" URL.  E.g. I found the [iRayMH25](https://youtu.be/ECGxVlh4kFY?t=1040) to be valid via Garand Thumb's video on Airsoft


### Animation Ideas
- [ ] What if my Forms could just be little Nodes that I click, a Card expands for submission and then a ghost arrow animates with a ghostie drop/textbox for the Relationship?  That would be cool!!!!
- [ ] An custom hero carousel [picker](https://youtu.be/29IQwtXVYqA?t=185) where it wipes, tilts the image a bit and has a Thumbs up or Thumbs down button.
- [ ] A ghostie [steps](https://daisyui.com/components/steps/)
- [ ] Draggable expanding [menu](https://youtu.be/29IQwtXVYqA?t=310) for anything
