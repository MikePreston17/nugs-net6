The goal of the project was to print as much of the AR-15 as possible, without compromising the performance.  Upgrade pack is here:  https://odysee.com/@hoffmantactical:3/Orca-Upgrades-V5.3.B:9?r=2aDZGs7DDG2yFGLCdktcVBDPBQ6mFt73  The following components that would be on a factory AR-15 have been replaced by printed or non-firearm parts, or made unnecessary: Upper, lower, handguard, buffer tube, barrel nut, stock, grip, takedown pins, buffer retainer, etc.… This list is not exhaustive, but gives the reader an idea of the scope of this project. The handguard and stock are attached to the receivers by tapered clips held in place by hose clamps. This system is strong and low profile. The split line of the upper and lower has been fully redesigned from the simple split on a standard AR-15. This has been done to improve the strength of the upper, the upper-lower connection, and make the parts easier to print. The barrel mount at a minimum should be printed from a high temperature filament, such as glass filled Nylon. Preferably the upper and handguard should also be printed from a high temp filament. These requirements, and the need for accurate prints that properly fit together, make this an advanced build. Proceed with care. Premade support and modifiers are included for convenience. With most printers the Orca will require approximately 100 hours of print time.  3dprinting ar15 guns hoffmantactical orca URL lbry://@hoffmantactical#3/Orca-V5.3#0 Claim ID 0d4ed10e121d6b371c4d688d06c24e630ec604a3 85.16 MB",
