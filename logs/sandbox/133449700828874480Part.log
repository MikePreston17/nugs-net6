Specifically designed for responsible armed citizens, law enforcement and professional security personnel who wish to upgrade their rifle or carbine to MCR performance and capability; standard features include gas-piston operation for extreme reliability in adverse conditions; a quick-change (3 seconds) barrel system available in 12 and 16 inch lengths and a MIL-STD 1913 or optional KeyMod co-planar hand-guard with rail-interface system for the mounting of optics and modern accessories. Spanning the capability range from the optic ready carbine through a lightweight support rifle; the MCR accepts standard box type AR15/M16 magazines or M27 linked ammunition at operator discretion, permitting unprecedented firepower and weapon flexibility.

DPMS Gen 1 Pattern Compatibility - 
Because the AR10/AR308 platform was never standardized by the US Military like the AR15 was, there are over a dozen different platforms on the market today. While most components (barrels, triggers, buffer tubes, stocks) are interchangeable, the fit between the upper and lower receivers are not. We utilize the DPMS Gen 1 pattern, as it is the most common and universal of the platforms. Popular brands to match to our lowers are:
 
-DPMS
-Aero Precision
-CMMG
-Thunder Tactical
-Anyone who lists DPMS Generation 1!
 
(We receive many requests about the Palmetto State Armory PA10 platform, and it will NOT work. To our knowledge, the PA10 platform is not compatible with any other brands outside of Palmetto State)

ECOTI is now available to vetted civilian customers exclusively through Tactical Night Vision Company. While some thermal systems have previously been available commercially, they have typically been a generation behind the latest military systems or with uncertain origin.

The AN/PAS-29B ECOTI is an improvement over the legacy AN/PAS-29A COTI first introduced almost a decade ago by Optics 1. ECOTI has a 640×480, 60Hz sensor (compared to COTI’s 320×240 / 30Hz), and has increased field of view by 50% from 20o to 30o. It provides the user with a high definition, real-time thermal overlay. Users can select between Outline, Patrol, and Full Thermal modes, as well as white and black hot polarities. It also has pre-programmed environmental settings to provide the best possible detection in a multitude of operating environments.

Despite the numerous enhancements in performance and capabilities compared to the legacy COTI, the ECOTI is almost a full two ounces lighter. To lighten the load even more, ECOTI is also available without the internal CR123 battery and powered by the Optics 1 6-Cell GPS-enabled External Battery Pack.

ECOTI has a multitude of applications for law enforcement and civilian customers. The thermal detection capability is useful for SAR operations, fugitive and suspect pursuit, and hunting in thick brush or heavy vegetation. Unlike other weapon-mounted thermal scopes and handheld thermal monoculars, ECOTI allows users to be heads-up and hands-free.

Unlike Image Fusion systems such as the FGE and ENVG-B, the ECOTI is a clip-on thermal overlay with a dedicated power supply. A loss of power or damage to either the night vision goggle or ECOTI does not deadline the entire system; users can use one without the other. They can attach the ECOTI to its Eyepiece Adapter and used as a handheld thermal monocular.  Image Fusion systems have complicated and costly maintenance and repairs, leaving users blind in the night.','','8899'),('UPPER GROUP, RESOLUTE, Mk4, 6.5 GRENDEL, 16.1" | CMMG - AR 15 and AR 10 Builds and Parts','','','','','899.95'),('UPPER GROUP, DISSENT, 9MM, 6.5" | CMMG - AR 15 and AR 10 Builds and Parts','','','','','1449.95'),('UPPER GROUP, BANSHEE, Mk10, 10MM, 8" | CMMG - AR 15 and AR 10 Builds and Parts','','','','','999.95'),('UPPER GROUP, RESOLUTE, Mk47, 7.62X39MM, 16.1" | CMMG - AR 15 and AR 10 Builds and Parts','AR-15','Upper','','','1099.95'),('UPPER GROUP, BANSHEE, Mk3, .308WIN, 12.5" | CMMG - AR 15 and AR 10 Builds and Parts','','','','','1149.95'),('UPPER GROUP, BANSHEE, Mk10, 10MM, 8" | CMMG - AR 15 and AR 10 Builds and Parts','','','','','999.95'),('Iray Usa Rico Micro Rh25 Thermal Hand Held/mountable Flat Dark Earth 1x 25mm 640x512, 50 Hz Resolution Digital 4x Zoom SS2','','','','IRAY USA LLC','5300'),('LAW Tactical Ar-15 Folding Stock Adapter GEN 3-M FDE','','','','','258.82'),('LAW Tactical AR Folding Stock Adapter GEN 3-M','','','','','252.94'),('ATN ThOR LT 3-6x50mm Thermal Rifle Scope 30mm Tube | 4.3 Star Rating w/ Free Shipping','','','','',''),('N-Vision Optics NOX-18 1-8x18mm Thermal Monocular | $500.00 Off w/ Free Shipping','','','','',''),('NOX18 Thermal Monocular – N-Vision Optics','','','<div class="specifications-table">

The NOX18 Is Built For Anyone Looking For A Do It All System.
Units like the NOX18 were never intended to be perfect in all applications. They are meant to perform at a high level in ALL situations. This affords more uses than dedicated units. Users can helmet mount the NOX18 using a bridge like the Mod Armory Bridge, or weapon mount using the included base. The capabilities and roles the NOX18 can play into are virtually endless. From search and rescue, to evasion, to navigation and engaging targets, the NOX18 can do all of it with good results.

The Mod Armory Bridge delivers function in a durable and reliable bridge unit. Take a look at Bridging a PVS-14 with any iRay Thermal for some necessary and cool information.

WHY SHOULD SOMEONE CHOOSE THE MOD ARMORY BRIDGE?
The Mod Armory bridge is a bit unique as it is machined and manufactured from aluminum. In many ways this is superior to polymer or 3D printed bridges in terms of strength. This bridge will weigh more than some other bridges (like the panobridge), but it makes up for that weight in form and function. The greatest attribute that we see with the Mod Armory Bridge is the fact that they have the adjustment necessary to properly run a thermal monocular (like the MH25) coupled with a PVS14. For users desiring this combination, they should purchase the Dovetail Adapter accessory for their MH25 unit(s).

WHO SHOULD CONSIDER THE MOD ARMORY BRIDGE?
For users simply looking to bridge two PVS14’s together, the Mod Armory VS panobridge debate is pretty much a wash. The panobridge wins in terms of weight. The mod armory bridge wins in terms of function and quick disconnect capabilities. Either will work fine.

For folks looking to run thermal AND night vision, the Mod Armory, in our opinion, is the clear winner. The reason for this is the added adjustment that the Mod Armory Bridge offers the end user. Mod Armory has nailed the features and function of this bridge.

We stock this bridge because we believe in it and have used it personally in the field over the last year extensively.','','599'),('Wilcox G24 Mount - Arkayne','','','','','511.95'),('SSP5 - Gas Blowback Pistol - Novritsch | USA','Airsoft','','','','289'),('3x Magnifier Lens for PVS-14','','','','','449'),('TRYBE Optics Enhancer™ - PVS-14 Night Vision Magnification Tripler | 30% Off w/ Free S&H','','','','','314'),('Armasight PVS-14 3x Lens | 11% Off w/ Free Shipping','','','','','249'),('40mm Tactical 4-Shot Launcher - Defense Technology','','','Designed for riot and tactical situations, the Defense Technology® 1440 40mm Tactical 4-Shot Launcher is low-profile and lightweight, providing multi-shot capability in an easy to carry launcher.

The HEKATE 338 signature suppressor doesn’t have any barrel length restrictions. The HEKATE 338 core is made of Direct Metal Laser Sintered (DMLS – 3D printed) heat treated 6AL4V (Grade 5) titanium. 6AL4V titanium is used to significantly reduce system weight while maintaining high strength. The DMLS manufacturing process was chosen as it allows for construction with less potential points of failure, lighter construction, improved sound reduction, and increased durability. The VCD Technology increases sound performance significantly especially with supersonic ammo compared to everything else available while also not sacrificing subsonic performance to achieve supersonic performance. It excels at both without compromise.','','338'),('Hyperion 7.62/5.56 Rifle Silencer Inconel by CGS','','','The CGS HYPERION 762 is a precision rifle silencer designed specifically with 7.62 mm ammunition in mind, up to and including 300 RUM.The patent pending proprietary technology unique to CGS Group LLC rifle silencers is unlike anything the firearms industry has ever seen before. This unique design allows for peak sound reduction and extreme reduction in flash signature as well as minimal and repeatable point of impact shift.

The HYPERION QD is constructed of 3-D printed titanium.  Continued research shows that the grain structure of DMLS produced titanium and other similarly produced alloy components can actually exhibit uniformity that is superior to that of traditionally produced alloy structures.  Due to the gas flow path geometry which vents gas expediently to the outer annulus, coupled with the uniform construction and proprietary heat treat process, it is postulated that the Hyperion exhibits higher durability not typically characteristic of titanium suppressors.

This PVS-14 is a Generation 3 white phosphorous mono tube Night Vision device made by Steele Industries out of Florida.

Features

The PVS-14 Night Vision Monocular System is the most versatile night vision monocular available today.  It is currently in use with all branches of the United States Military as well as many Law Enforcement Agencies.  It can be used handheld, weapon mounted or helmet mounted.  It is also the preferred night vision optic for many foreign NATO forces. 
It allows the user to view their surroundings in full Gen 3 night vision detail while maintaining their natural vision in their unaided eye.  The PVS-14 can easily be weapon mounted behind most collimated and reflex daytime optics.  Some common examples include Trijicon ACOG, Aimpoint and Eotech Systems. 
Gain control allows the user to adjust the brightness of the unit so that he or she can have the perfect balance of night vision clarity without a blinding excess of light.  The PVS-14 also has an onboard IR illuminator for use in extremely dark environments at short range. 
The units are extremely well built and carry a 10 year warranty.  Gen 3 image intensifier tubes have an average life span exceeding 10,000 hours of continuous use before any noticeable performance degradation.  This means that the unit will likely last more than the lifetime of the average user. 
         The PVS-14 utilizes a single AA battery. The PVS-14 has a field of view of 40 degrees. This is the same FOV you would receive if you owned a goggle setup. It is often said that you will have depth perception issues with the PVS-14, but that is not the case. You just have one eye that can see through the device and one eye that does not. This will send mix signals to the brain when in use until you properly train under them. You won’t be able to just throw on a pair of night vision and run before you can walk. We recommend looking into training solutions from qualified instructors in your area.

The patented NL914C Power Pack by Nightline, Inc.™ takes the PVS-14 night vision monocular to the next level by rethinking the entire battery housing. Its unique layout allows the use of shorter but more powerful CR123A lithium batteries in the same tray as the AA battery. The user can choose to use CR123A or AA batteries as desired. When used in conjunction with high-draw, filmless white phosphor tubes, it is possible to double or even triple the PVS-14's run time by using more powerful and longer-lasting, higher voltage CR123A batteries through Nightline's hardened digital circuitry.

-

Plus, the design offers significant weight savings: the NL914C Power Pack weighs only 1.6 oz / 45 g total, or approximately 36% less than a traditional single-AA battery housing (which weighs 2.5 oz / 71 g). If the goal is to relieve the strain on your neck and make it easier for you to focus on the task at hand, this product delivers.

-

Finally, the #1 failure point on milspec PVS-14 housings are the rotary dials for power and gain control. These relatively fragile dials are completely replaced by push buttons on the NL914C Power Pack, leading to much better long-term durability and vastly improved water resistance. There is no maintenance required, and the controls are easy to press and very intuitive. Simply click the power button once to turn the monocular off or on, press and hold the + or - button to change gain, and click the IR button to momentarily activate the built-in infrared illuminator or double click it for constant on.

-

A proprietary, Noisefighters-designed protective button fence is preinstalled on each NL914C Power Pack that we sell, in order to eliminate the possibility of errant button presses, especially when the unit is stowed in a pouch. The fence provides a raised polymer surface around one side of the buttons and still allows full button actuation with or without gloves on.

-

A 1-year warranty is included. The NL914C Power Pack is proudly made and assembled in the U.S.A.

 

CONSIDERATIONS TO ACCOUNT FOR WHEN USING THIS PRODUCT:
We recommend hiring a professional to both install this item and purge your monocular with inert gas. The inert gas prevents fogging in humid climates. However, if you are a DIYer, it is possible to install this item without special tools. There is some information online about completing a PVS-14 purge, but without a professional setup, it will be impossible to leak test the gas seal. If you are in a dry climate, purging is not necessarily imperative, but it may matter in a more humid climate, and it is especially important if the monocular is to be used in a professional capacity.

It is recommended to use CR-123A batteries for general use, as they tend to produce the longest run time. Use of RCR-123A (rechargeable variant) is permitted, but the run time will likely be severely degraded due to lower battery capacities.

When using AA batteries, it recommended to use alkaline variants, as fresh AA lithium batteries may trigger the internal, blinking, low-voltage indicator light. This is because, depending on the ambient temperature and state of charge in the lithium AA battery, the NL914C Power Pack circuitry may misinterpret the lithium AA battery's higher voltage instead as a CR-123A battery in a low-voltage (dying) condition.

QD mount and Light Suppressor Kit is compatible with HOGSTER C (BE43142) and SUPER YOTER C (BE46150) Thermal Clip-Ons. 

The QD mount allows placing the Clip-On on the Picatinny rail in front of and in-line with daytime optic scopes that have medium or high-profile rings.

The Light Suppressor is optional, but strongly recommended. When it is screwed on a Clip-On unit, it stays between the unit and your daytime scope, which helps to suppress sun light when you are using the unit during daytime hours (when sighting, proofing your zero before a hunt, etc.).

Mounting a Clip-On with this kit is only possible when you have enough Picatinny rail length in front of your daytime scope.  

The most common example of this set-up is an AR-platform or a bolt-action rifle with a longer Picatinny rail in front of the scope which, after hunting a deer before the sunset, you need to quickly re-equip for shooting a hog or a coyote at night. It is a really fast and easy conversion. 

The Light Suppressor screws directly onto the Clip-On and the Clip-On mounts on Picatinny rail in front of your daytime scope with the QD mount. 

Once a Clip-On with the QD Mount is zeroed on your rifle, it keeps the zero when it is taken off and put back into the same Picatinny slot.','',''),('SB Tactical SBA3 AR Pistol Stabilizing Brace - Black - Open Box','','','','','89.12'),('BN - SBA3 Pistol Lower Build Kit - Adjustable Pistol Brace','','','BARE NECESSITIES SBA3 PISTOL LOWER BUILD KIT WITH ADJUSTABLE PISTOL BRACE

Developed as a next generation intermediate assault rifle to replace the Type 64, the Type 89 is the current day issued infantry weapon for the Japan Self-Defense Force. Chambered in the 5.56x45mm NATO cartridge, the Type 89 offered many immediate advantages such as easing the load on each individual soldier as well as allow a greater amount of ammunition to be carried. The simplified manufacturing and mechanics of the rifle not only decreased acquisition costs, but in turn also made the rifle easier to use and maintain thanks to its minimal number of components. Made from aluminum and thermoset plastics, the Type 89 is lighter and quicker to bring to bear on a threat.

The Tokyo Marui Type 89 Gas Blow Back rifle is an accurate replica featuring an aluminum receiver and polymer furniture. The GBB design features a reciprocating bolt which simulates the bolt cycle and recoil of its real life counterpart. As with all Tokyo Marui guns, attention to detail has not been spared in this recreation; everything from the functional last round bolt lock to the sliding dust cover that automatically opens during firing to the quick detach bipod was made to be as close to the real thing as possible.

US HPA FITTING as standard

We’ve taken feedback on thousands of M4 HPA adapters sold throughout 2022, to build what we believe to be the perfect HPA adapter. A CNC feed tube and recessed CNC mag release provide lifelong longevity, a flared magwell enables speedy mag changes, and an adjustable shim gives excellent magazine compatibility and fitment (though you won’t need it for most magazines!).

Our whole team worked their magic in creating a beautiful aesthetic that suits the pistol, while still keeping bulk to a minimum.

It doesn’t end there, we offer excellent product support, lifetime warranty, and include spare parts should you or your team ever need them!

We added several new color pallets, giving the Incendis Pro a whopping nine pallet options paired with four different reticles that will display in three different colors. This Clip On Thermal has an external 5000 milliamp battery with a five hour run time and records HD video. The onboard wifi allows the Incendis Pro to link to our app and provide the user with a variety of viewing options.
