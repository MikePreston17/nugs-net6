Specifically designed for responsible armed citizens, law enforcement and professional security personnel who wish to upgrade their rifle or carbine to MCR performance and capability; standard features include gas-piston operation for extreme reliability in adverse conditions; a quick-change (3 seconds) barrel system available in 12 and 16 inch lengths and a MIL-STD 1913 or optional KeyMod co-planar hand-guard with rail-interface system for the mounting of optics and modern accessories. Spanning the capability range from the optic ready carbine through a lightweight support rifle; the MCR accepts standard box type AR15/M16 magazines or M27 linked ammunition at operator discretion, permitting unprecedented firepower and weapon flexibility.

DPMS Gen 1 Pattern Compatibility - 
Because the AR10/AR308 platform was never standardized by the US Military like the AR15 was, there are over a dozen different platforms on the market today. While most components (barrels, triggers, buffer tubes, stocks) are interchangeable, the fit between the upper and lower receivers are not. We utilize the DPMS Gen 1 pattern, as it is the most common and universal of the platforms. Popular brands to match to our lowers are:
 
-DPMS
-Aero Precision
-CMMG
-Thunder Tactical
-Anyone who lists DPMS Generation 1!
 
(We receive many requests about the Palmetto State Armory PA10 platform, and it will NOT work. To our knowledge, the PA10 platform is not compatible with any other brands outside of Palmetto State)

Compatible with both DPMS and SR-25 Magazines.
